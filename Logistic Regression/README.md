# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression and Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on health measurements using **Logistic Regression**.  
It includes:  

1. **Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis**  
2. **Training a Logistic Regression model**  
3. **Saving the trained model**  
4. **Interactive web app using Streamlit** for predictions

## Dataset

- File: `diabetes.csv`  
- Contains health measurements and `Outcome` column (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)  
- Features:  
  - Pregnancies  
  - Glucose  
  - BloodPressure  
  - SkinThickness  
  - Insulin  
  - BMI  
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
  - Age

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Libraries

Open **CMD** or **PowerShell** in the project folder and run:

```cmd
python -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib streamlit
````

---

### 2. Train the Model (if not already trained)

1. Open `logistic_regression_diabetes.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to:

   * Load and preprocess the dataset
   * Train the logistic regression model
   * Save the trained model as `log_model.pkl`

---

### 3. Run the Streamlit App

1. Open **CMD** in the project folder:

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\91705\codes_vip\python_practice\Untitled Folder\Assignment_8_Vipul"
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```cmd
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

3. After a few seconds, Streamlit will show something like:

```
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

4. Open your browser and paste the **Local URL**.

---

### 4. Using the App

* Enter values for each input field (Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, etc.)
* Click **Predict**
* The app will display:

  * ✅ Low chance of Diabetes
  * ⚠️ High chance of Diabetes

---

## Notes for Beginners

* Always use `cd "folder path"` to go into the folder in CMD
* Never run `streamlit_app.py` directly with `python file.py`
* Always run Streamlit apps with:

```cmd
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

* Keep `log_model.pkl` in the same folder as the `.py` file

---

## Model Evaluation

* Metrics computed in notebook:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-Score
  * ROC-AUC
* Visualizations: Histograms, Pairplots, ROC curve
* Feature importance analyzed using model coefficients
