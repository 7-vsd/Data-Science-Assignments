ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
Case Study: SONAR — Detecting Mines vs. Rocks
1️⃣ Business Objective
Goal:
To build an intelligent system that can automatically detect whether an underwater sonar signal is reflected from a metallic mine (potentially dangerous) or a harmless rock.
This is vital for:
•	Maritime safety: Prevent ships and submarines from colliding with mines.
•	Naval defense: Identify and safely remove underwater mines.
•	Resource exploration: Distinguish between useful metal structures and natural seabed objects.

2️⃣ Problem Statement
In underwater environments, sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is used to detect objects. However, raw sonar signals can be noisy and difficult for humans to interpret consistently.
This dataset:
•	Contains 208 sonar returns.
o	111 are from metal cylinders (mines).
o	97 are from rocks.
•	Each sonar return is represented by 60 numeric features, each measuring the energy of the signal in a frequency band.

The problem:
👉 To train a Deep learning model that can learn the difference in signal patterns and classify new sonar signals as either Mine (M) or Rock (R) — accurately and reliably.




Dataset: "sonardataset.csv"
Features (Inputs)
•	There are 60 numerical variables, each representing the energy in a specific frequency band of the sonar signal.
•	In the original dataset, they’re just unnamed columns V1, V2, ..., V60 — you can keep it clear and simple:
2️⃣ Target (Output)
•	The label is a single categorical variable indicating:
o	"M" for Mine
o	"R" for Rock

Tasks
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
●	Begin by loading and exploring the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset. Summarize its key features such as the number of samples, features, and classes.
●	Execute necessary data preprocessing steps including data normalization, managing missing values.
2. Model Implementation
●	Construct a basic ANN model using your chosen high-level neural network library. Ensure your model includes at least one hidden layer.
●	Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
●	Train your model on the training set and then use it to make predictions on the test set.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
●	Modify various hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, activation functions, and learning rate, to observe their impact on model performance.
●	Adopt a structured approach like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning, documenting your methodology thoroughly.
4. Evaluation
●	Employ suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate your model's performance.
●	Discuss the performance differences between the model with default hyperparameters and the tuned model, emphasizing the effects of hyperparameter tuning.
